      <h2>What is Mars?</h2>
      <div class="what">
      <p class="marswhat"> Mars is a planet. It is the fourth planet from the sun. It is the next planet beyond Earth. Mars is more than 142 million miles from the sun. The planet is about one-sixth the size of Earth. Mars is known as the Red Planet. It gets its red color from the iron in its soil. Mars has two small moons. Their names are Phobos and Deimos. </p>

    <h2> Why Mars? </h2>
    <div class="why">
      <p class="marswhy">
        <ul>
          <li>Its soil contains water to extract</li>
          <li>It isnâ€™t too cold or too hot</li>
          <li>There is enough sunlight to use solar panels</li>
          <li>Gravity on Mars is 38% that of our Earth's, which is believed by many to be sufficient for the human body to adapt to</li>
          <li>It has an atmosphere (albeit a thin one) that offers protection from cosmic and the Sun's radiation</li>
          <li>The day/night rhythm is very similar to ours here on Earth: a Mars day is 24 hours, 39 minutes and 35 seconds</li></ul></p>
